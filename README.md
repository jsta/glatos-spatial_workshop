## Overview

## Learning objectives

Workshop participants will learn ...

## Is this course for me?

You should be comfortable with routine R programming tasks (such as writing functions, indexing vectors and lists).

Your (lack of) previous experience with X is not an issue. If you have experience, you'll see things in a new way. If you don't, we'll get you started on the right footing.

## Prework

1. Use your own system to install a working environment:
    - Scroll up on this GitHub page to the green "clone or download" button. Copy the link and use it on your system to create a new project with "New project/Version control system/GitHub".
    - When your project is created, look at the file `setup.R`. Install any packages there that you don't already have installed. 

2. (An alternative to (1) if you can't (or don't want to) use your own RStudio system--e.g. a laptop or an institutional server.) Shortly before the workshop starts, open up a new project in `rstudio.cloud` by following this link: [rstudio.cloud/project/878317](https://rstudio.cloud/project/878317). 
    - You may be prompted to set up an account, which is free. If you already have an account, use that.
    - Your `rstudio.cloud` project is yours and you can leave it for future reference or delete it after the workshop: your choice.
    - Packages will be pre-installed on `rstudio.cloud`
